This is the repository cloned:

```text

```

1. Get into the exercise folder: `$ cd exercise-unit-test-with-jest`
2. Download learnpack globally (if you don't have it already): `$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g`

## What is this exercise about?

We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

| Function name    | Description                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fromDollarToYen  | Receives a dollar amount and returns the equivalent amount in Japan Yen  |
| fromEuroToDollar | Receives a Euro amount and returns the equivalent amount in US Dollar    |
| fromYenToPound   | Receives a Yen amount and returns the equivalent amount in England Pound |
